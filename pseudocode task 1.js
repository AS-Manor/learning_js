
// 1. Reading List
/* Keep track of which books you read and which books you want to read!

 Create an array of objects, where each object describes a book and has properties
 for the title(a string), author(a string), and already read(a boolean indicating if you read it yet).

 Iterate through the array of books.For each book, log the book title and book author
 like so: “The Hobbit by J.R.R.Tolkien”.

 Now use an if/else statement to change the output depending on whether you read
 it yet or not. If you read it, log a string like ‘You already read “The Hobbit”
 by J.R.R. Tolkien’, and if not, log a string like ‘You still need to read “The
 Lord of the Rings” by J.R.R. Tolkien.’*/

 // Pseudocode
 // declare a variable called books
// make it an array
// create an object consisting of title, author and already read for each book
// initialise i = 0
// loop while i < books length
// assign book to books[i]
// assign book info to book.title and book.author
// if book.alreadyread
// output you already read 
// else 
// output you still need to read
